## Supported Platforms

You can run this sample project in the Unity Editor and also build it for the following platforms:
* Android 8 and above.
* iOS 13 and above.

## Controls

In the Unity Editor:
* Click and drag the letter to the desired position.

On mobile devices, without screen reader:
* Tap and drag the letter to the desired position.

On mobile devices, with screen reader:
* Tap a letter directly to focus it, or use swipe gestures to focus the desired letter.
* Double tap to select the focused letter.
* Use swipe gestures to move the letter forward or backward, OR tap another directly to insert focused letter in that position.
